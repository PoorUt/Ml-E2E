    2- Feature selection and Feature Engineering
    3- Modeli Building
    4- Model Deployment

These are the Software and account Requirement.
You should have a github account, Heroku Account, VS code IDE, and GIt cli in your pc.

If you dont have these you can get them from the links below.

1. [Github Account](https://github.com)
2. [Heroku Account](https://dashboard.heroku.com/login)
3. [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
4. [GIT cli](https://git-scm.com/download)


The Next step will be to create a simple hello world flask application and deploy it to heroku using docker.
First of all we will configure our continous integration and continous deployment (CI-CD) pipeline in a fully automated way using git hub excels.
So, if we make any changes to our code, the automated CI-CD pipeline will continously trigger the deployment to heroku.

In this project we will create a simple hello world application and try to deploy in Heroku using docker
